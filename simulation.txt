Block Structure:
The block class defines a block with an index, timestamp, data, and hash linking it to the previous block.

Hashing:
SHA-256 is used to hash the contents of each block, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

Blockchain Class:
The blockchain class manages the chain of blocks,adds new block, and checks the chain's validity.

Proof of work:
The nonce is shown for each block, which is the value that was changed to find the valid hash.
